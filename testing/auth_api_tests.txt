# ----- DEBUGGING TIPS -----
# 
# 1. Add -v flag for verbose output:
#    curl -v -X POST https://carfuse.pl/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'
# 
# 2. To check cookies after login:
#    cat cookies.txt
#
# 3. To test with a JWT header:
#    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" https://carfuse.pl/api/auth/userDetails
#
# 4. For Windows PowerShell:
#    - Replace single quotes with double quotes and escape inner quotes
#    - Use ` (backtick) for line continuation instead of \
