CarFuse Front-End Analysis Report
After analyzing the front-end structure in relation to the controllers and file organization, I've identified several issues that need attention. Here's a comprehensive breakdown by file category:

JavaScript Files Issues
alpine.js

Missing main initialization that should import the component files from /js/alpine-components/
No clear entry point that registers Alpine with window.Alpine
No initialization code connecting with the component modules (core.js, ui.js, form.js, etc.)
htmx.js

Contains some helpers for bookings and payments but lacks initialization code
Missing CSRF token handling mentioned in controllers
Missing Polish language error messages
Incomplete connection with notification handling methods
tailwind.config.js

Exists but may not be properly configured for Polish language support
No evidence of purging rules for PHP files
Missing theme extensions for CarFuse-specific components
main.js

Missing initialization code for all other JavaScript components
No global event handlers setup
Missing Polish locale configuration for date/currency formatting
User View Issues
/public/views/user/dashboard.php

References getUserStatistics() but implementation in DashboardController expects different parameters
Uses $_SESSION['user_name'] which isn't consistently set in AuthController
Missing HTMX integration for real-time updates
Incomplete notification handling compared to NotificationController's capabilities
/public/views/user/bookings.php

Missing reference to BookingController's getBookingListHtmx() method
No clear implementation of booking cancellation flow that matches controller's cancelBooking() method
Incomplete integration with booking-list-item.php partial
Missing HTMX pagination that should call getUserBookings()
/public/views/user/payments.php and payments-history.php

Duplicate functionality between two files - should be consolidated
PaymentController methods not fully represented in the views
Missing integration with payment-details.php and payment-method-details.php
No HTMX calls to lazy-load payment details
/public/views/user/profile.php

Missing form validation with Alpine.js that should match UserController validation rules
No clear HTMX submission to UserController's updateUserProfile() method
Missing connection to profile picture upload functionality
Admin View Issues
/public/views/admin/dashboard.php

Missing HTMX integration for dashboard data refreshing
Incomplete links to admin dashboard API endpoints
No proper admin session validation aligned with AdminDashboardController requirements
/public/views/admin/users.php

Missing template reference to user-row.php partial
Incomplete HTMX integration for user management functions
Missing Alpine.js modals for user actions that align with AdminController methods
/public/views/admin/reports.php

Missing form implementation for report generation that matches ReportController's generateReport() method
Incomplete date range picker integration
Missing export format options mentioned in ReportController
/public/views/admin/settings.php

No clear connection to any controller method
Missing form controls for system settings
Incomplete tab implementation with Alpine.js
Partials Issues
/public/views/partials/notifications-list.php

Missing role-based conditional logic that should adapt to admin vs user context
Incomplete integration with NotificationController methods
No HTMX calls for marking notifications as read
Modal Component Issues

modal.php exists but doesn't appear to be fully implemented
Missing Alpine.js integration for show/hide functionality
Missing standardized modal types for different actions
User-Related Partials

Inconsistent naming between partials (user-bookings.php vs booking-list-item.php)
Missing reuse of common components
Authentication & Security Issues
Session Handling

Inconsistent session checks across views
Some files use direct $_SESSION access while others should use TokenService
Missing proper redirection for unauthenticated users
CSRF Protection

Missing CSRF token implementation in forms
No consistent HTMX header for CSRF as mentioned in controllers
Role-Based Access

Inconsistent admin role verification
Some views missing proper role checks that match controller expectations
Internationalization Issues
Polish Language Support
Inconsistent use of Polish text across views
Missing Polish date and currency formatting in some views
Hardcoded English strings in some files
Recommendations
Standardize Authentication

Implement consistent session or token validation in all views
Create a helper function for authentication checks
Complete JavaScript Files

Properly implement the main.js initialization
Complete Alpine.js integration with proper component structure
Implement HTMX utilities for all controller endpoints
Fix View-Controller Alignment

Ensure all controller methods have corresponding UI elements
Implement HTMX calls that match controller endpoints
Polish Language Consistency

Replace all hardcoded English text with Polish equivalents
Implement consistent date and currency formatting for Polish locale
Reorganize Duplicated Functionality

Consolidate payments.php and payments-history.php
Standardize partial naming and usage
By addressing these issues, the CarFuse front-end will be more consistent, maintainable, and properly integrated with its back-end controllers.
