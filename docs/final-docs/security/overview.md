# CarFuse Security Overview

*Last updated: 2023-11-15*

This document provides a high-level overview of the security implementation within the CarFuse application framework. Security is implemented as cross-cutting concerns across both server-side and client-side components.

## Security Principles

The CarFuse security system is built on these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege** - Users and processes have minimal necessary access
3. **Secure by Default** - Security features are enabled out of the box
4. **Visibility** - Security events are logged and monitored
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular updates to security mechanisms

## Key Security Features

The CarFuse framework provides several integrated security features:

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Authentication | User identity verification | [Authentication Guide](authentication.md) |
| Authorization | Role-based access control | [RBAC Guide](../components/auth/rbac.md) |
| CSRF Protection | Cross-site request forgery prevention | [CSRF Guide](csrf-protection.md) |
| Session Management | Secure handling of user sessions | [Session Management](authentication.md#session-management) |
| Security Logging | Recording security-related events | [Security Logging](best-practices.md#security-logging) |

## Security Architecture

The CarFuse security system consists of the following core components:

1. **SecurityService** - Core service for authentication and authorization
2. **SecurityMiddleware** - Request pipeline security enforcement
3. **CarFuseSecurity** - Client-side security implementation
4. **RBAC System** - Role-Based Access Control implementation
5. **Security Event Logging** - Audit trail for security events

### Server-Side Components

The server-side security implementation centers around the `SecurityService` and `SecurityMiddleware` classes, which handle:

- User authentication
- Role verification
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Session management
- Security event logging

### Client-Side Components

Client-side security is implemented through the `CarFuseSecurity` object, which provides:

- Authentication state management
- Role-based UI rendering
- CSRF token management for AJAX requests
- Secure form submission

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing security features in your application:

1. Always use the provided security services rather than custom implementations
2. Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
3. Validate all user input on both client and server sides
4. Log security events for auditing purposes
5. Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities

> **Note:** Security is only as strong as the weakest link. Ensure all components follow these guidelines.
