# API Overview

## Introduction
Overview of the CarFuse API. This RESTful API provides programmatic access to CarFuse's vehicle data, user management, and diagnostic services. It enables developers to integrate vehicle information, maintenance records, and diagnostics into third-party applications.

## Design Principles and Conventions
-   RESTful architecture
-   Predictable resource URLs
-   HTTP verbs for actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
-   JSON for request and response bodies
-   Consistent naming conventions
-   Resource-oriented design with clear hierarchies
-   Stateless operations for horizontal scalability
-   Idempotent operations where applicable
-   Hypermedia links for discoverability (HATEOAS)
-   Comprehensive error reporting with actionable details

## Authentication
-   JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication via `Authorization` header
-   Token-based authentication for statelessness
-   Secure handling of credentials
-   Tokens must be included as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
-   OAuth2.0 flow supported for third-party applications
-   Refresh tokens provided with 14-day validity
-   Access tokens expire after 1 hour
-   HTTPS required for all API calls

## Rate Limiting
-   Implemented to prevent abuse and ensure availability
-   Based on IP address and/or user account
-   Details in response headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`)
-   Standard tier: 1000 requests per hour
-   Premium tier: 5000 requests per hour
-   Burst allowance: Short bursts exceeding limits are permitted
-   429 responses include a Retry-After header
-   Rate limits are applied per endpoint category

## Versioning
-   API versioning using URI path (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
-   Backward compatibility maintained as much as possible
-   Clear communication of breaking changes
-   Deprecation notices provided at least 6 months in advance
-   Multiple versions supported simultaneously during transition periods
-   Version-specific documentation available
-   Header-based version override available for testing: `Accept-Version: v2`

## Base URL Structure
`https://carfuse.example.com/api/v1/`

Resource paths follow a logical hierarchy:
- `/vehicles` - Vehicle resources
- `/users` - User management
- `/diagnostics` - Diagnostic services
- `/maintenance` - Maintenance records
- `/reports` - Reporting services

## Common HTTP Status Codes
-   200 OK: Success
-   201 Created: Resource created successfully
-   204 No Content: Request processed successfully, no content returned
-   400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or parameters
-   401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
-   403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions
-   404 Not Found: Resource not found
-   409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current state of the target resource
-   422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation errors in request
-   429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded
-   500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error
-   503 Service Unavailable: System temporarily unavailable

## Request Format
Standard format for API requests:

- Content-Type must be `application/json` unless uploading files
- Request bodies should be valid JSON
- Query parameters used for filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Special characters in URL parameters must be URL-encoded
- Datetime values should use ISO 8601 format (UTC)
- Requests with invalid JSON will receive a 400 Bad Request response
- Large requests (>1MB) should use pagination or streaming endpoints

## Response Format
Standard format for API responses:

- All responses are JSON (`application/json`) unless specified otherwise
- Standard envelope format with `data` and `meta` fields
- Error responses include an `error` object with code and message
- Collections include pagination information
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format (UTC)
- All IDs are strings, even if they appear numeric
- Consistent field naming with camelCase
- See `/api/responses.md` for detailed response formats
